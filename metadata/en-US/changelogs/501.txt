New:
- Regex mode: CNAP(Caller Name Presentation)
  - Use case: 
    - For countries that enforce KYC-verified CNAP, calls have a display name are likely valid.
  - Call log now shows caller name if it exists, e.g., 12345 (Some Name)

Fixes:
- MMS doesn't work with Textra being the SMS app
- Language switching fails randomly (~20% chance on some devices)

Enhancements:
- Filter history logs by keyword
- Use SIM 1/2 instead of 0/1 
- Tap the balloon tooltip to dismiss it
- New regex presets:
  - Caller Name
    - Allow calls with CNAP information
  - Forwarded Call
    - Block forwarded calls like "111&222"
  - SIM 2 Contacts
    - Allow contacts on SIM 2 and block all others
- New workflow preset:
  - Custom Tile
    - Temporarily toggle rules using the Quick Tile
